# xss_sql_injections_test

## Simple Admin-panel for testing XSS &amp; SQL-Injections  

I made this simple project for learning and testing how xss and sql-injections works and how to protect web-site from them.  

All XSS for testing at file:  
xss_examples.txt

All SQL-Injections for testing at file:  
sql_injection_examples.txt

Types of XSS:
1. Stored XSS  
2. Reflected XSS  
3. DOM Based XSS  

How works htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() inside
